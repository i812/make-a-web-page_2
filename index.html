	<h1>Summary of Concepts</h1>
	

	<div class="basics">
	<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
		<p>The web consist of a bunch of computers sharing documents over the internet.  A typical web page is stored on a server and when a client computer wants to use that document it uses a web browser to read the <em>HTML</em> documents stored on the server.  The web browser decodes the document on to the user's computer screen.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>HTML</b> - Hypertext Markup Language - Makes up a huge portion of the web's content.</li>
			<li>Contains the text that makes up the majority of all of the web pages on the World Wide Web.</li>
			<li>These HTML documents also contain tags and elements that are used to format how the document looks.</li>
			<li>HTML elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b></li></ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Inline</b> - tend to flow along within the text content</li>
				<li><b>Block</b> - tend to expand naturally to fill their parent container and can have margins and padding.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Making a Structured HTML Document</h2>
		<p>There are a lot of tools and techniques that the web developer can leverage to make the construction of a good web page easier.  Combine those with a good understanding of how to break down and manipulate HTML and you can build a nice looking page pretty easily.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Tree Structure</b> - HTML elements can contain other elements inside of them</li>
		
			<li>Similar to a parent to child relationship</li>
			<li>Traits from one level are passed on to the lower ones</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Developer Tools</b> - Where do we find them and what are they useful for</li>
		
			<li>Can be found in the web browser</li>
			<li>Can be used to "play" with existing web pages to learn about how they are formatted</li>
		
			<li><b>Choosing a Text Editor</b> - What to use when writing HTML</li>
		
			<li>Programmers need special editors - Such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.5.html">Notepad++</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a></li>
			<li>Many have auto formatting and auto completion for standard commands and tags</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Adding Style to Structure</h2>
		<p>In this portion of the training we cover ways to work with the code more efficiently with reference to how the pages are styled</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> - A cool and easy way to manage the style of your web content</li>
		
			<li>Helps the developer avoid redundant coding</li>
				<li>Reduces the chance for errors caused by copying and pasting structuring code</li>
				<li>Makes for smaller, more compact pages</li>
				<li> In my opinion it makes viewing the code and understanding it easier</li>
		
			<li><b>Code Validation Tools</b> - We were given a couple of web pages that we can use to validate our code</li>
		
			<li>HTML code can be validated at <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">Paste your HTML code here</a></li>
			<li>CSS code can be validated at <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">Paste your CSS code here</a></li>
		</ul>
